# The plugin will only work if the showDeathMessages gamerule is set to true
#
# Builtin placeholders:
#  %victim%
#
# These only work in the KILLED message:
#  %attacker%
#  %item% - It's recommended to install InteractiveChat
#
# Also in the KILLED message you can parse placeholders as the killer like this:
# normal: %statistic_player_kills%
# parsed as attacker: %[ATTACKER]statistic_player_kills%
#
# To remove a death message set the text to an empty string: ""

# list of all the valid death causes: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityDamageEvent.DamageCause.html
# note: the plugin already auto generates them when the server starts
